LBalance is a Clinometer or Balance app written in Python.

The Project displays angles with respect to the orientation of your device.
It offers a number of switchable graphic layouts and offers a calibration.
The app is a really useless addition to the collection of apps as
hundreds of similar apps exists out in the world, but maybe you find it
nice.
