LBalance is an app that uses the acceleration sensors of the device
to move graphical objects on the screen. LBalance can also be used as
a protractor or spirit level.

Several graphical representations have been implemented. Beside
own creations there are layouts inspired from the layout of known
similar apps.

The different layouts can be switched by the user. Also
exists an overview display for direct selection.

The calibration of the angle display follows the pattern of simple apps
of this kind and applies to each main orientation of the device
separately.
